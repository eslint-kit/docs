# Check out the new version of ESLint Kit

[The new ESLint Kit is released!](https://github.com/eslint-kit/eslint-kit)

The new version has solved a lot of problems:

* You don't need `@eslint-kit/cli` anymore:
  * Only **one** dependency. No `eslint`, no `prettier`, no plugins, parsers, resolvers and so on.
  * Blazingly fast setup. Just install `@eslint-kit/configure`, create `.eslintrc.js` and select presets you need.
  * Very short syntax, including alises setup.
  * The order of preset calls is no longer matter
* ESLint v8 and new versions of everything
* A lot of presets, including `vue`, `solid`, `svelte`, `nest.js` and other technologies
* Automatic updates for `typescript` preset - no warnings in console
* Better version control
